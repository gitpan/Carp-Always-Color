Revision history for Carp::Always::Color

0.07  2013-01-02
      - Carp::Always::Color now no longer falls back to HTML coloring by
        default (you can get this behavior by using Carp::Always::Color::HTML
        explicitly, if desired). Carp::Always::Color itself now just leaves the
        output uncolored for non-terminal outputs.
